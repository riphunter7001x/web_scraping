# My Web Scraping Journey
This repository contains my learnings and projects related to web scraping. As a data enthusiast, I have always been fascinated by the vast amounts of data available on the internet, and web scraping is one of the most powerful techniques for extracting this data.

## What I've Learned
In this repository, I have documented my learnings related to web scraping. I have covered the following topics:

- Introduction to web scraping
- HTML and CSS basics
- Introduction to the BeautifulSoup and Pandas libraries in Python
- Scraping data from various websites, such as Flipkart and Kheldekho's IPL website
- Automating web browsing tasks using Selenium

## Requirements
To run the project, you need to have the following software installed on your machine:

- Python (version 3 or above)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Selenium (Python library)
- A web driver (e.g., chromedriver, geckodriver) for Selenium, compatible with your browser version

## Projects
This repository also includes the following projects that I have worked on:

## Project 1: Flipkart Mobile Phone List
This project involved scraping a list of mobile phones from Flipkart's website, including multiple pages, and storing the data in a Pandas dataframe. I used BeautifulSoup and Pandas libraries in Python to extract the data.

## Project 2: IPL Most Run Player
In this project, I scraped data on the most run player in IPL from Kheldekho's website. I used BeautifulSoup and Pandas libraries in Python to extract the data.

## Project 3: Selenium Automation
This project demonstrated how to perform web browsing automation tasks using Selenium. I automated various tasks, such as clicking buttons, filling out forms, and navigating web pages.

## How to Use
To use this repository, simply clone it to your local machine and open the Jupyter Notebook files. The code is well-documented, and each project is self-contained.
